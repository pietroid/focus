# When clicking on thing opens page with subthings

_Many things often have sub topics or subtasks we need to handle. This feature enables the managing of those subthings_

## Why:

We have encountered some cases where we needed to annotate some subtopics inside a topic or even subtasks inside a task. It would be good if we had some page to edit the subcontent of a thing and make it possible to reorder, etc.

## What:

- Add a > sign at the right of the card
- When the user taps it, it will open a new screen with the children of this main thing
- The user can then edit those children as different sections of this thing

## How:

- Understand how we will name the routing
- Add an action to the base card
- Use the children to show the subthings
